# Fudan Thesis 2022
LaTeX thesis template for CS undergraduates, Fudan University, 2022.
The most critical principle of this template is to follow the official instruction [计算机学院、软件学院本科毕业论文撰写规范.docx](计算机学院、软件学院本科毕业论文撰写规范.docx) provided by the CS department, Fudan University.
This is the first time that I use LaTeX for Chinese so this implementation may not be very elegant. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions, comments or suggestions.

See [fducs2022_thesis_template.pdf](fducs2022_thesis_template.pdf) for the output.

## Usage
Update: Now you can directly open the Overleaf template from this [link](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/fducs2022-thesis-template/vhktvztpykpw).

~~Download the zip version of this repo. Open a new project on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project) and upload the zip file. Compile `main.tex` and it's done. Remember to switch the compiler to `XeLaTeX`, or you will encounter problems.~~
